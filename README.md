## Gulp ZSH Completion

This is a simple ZSH plugin for gulp task completion.

I wrote this because the official one has a noticable delay before producing completion results. This one does not have that delay. However, this comes with the tradeoff that this *only works with single-file gulp configurations!* I may investigate expanding that in the future.

## Installation

**Recommended:** Install using [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen):

    antigen bundle emallson/gulp-zsh-completion

**Manual:**

Clone repository and source the file in your .zshrc
